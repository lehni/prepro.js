 *
 * prepro.js is a simple preprocesssor for JavaScript that speaks JavaScript,
 * written in JavaScript, allowing preprocessing to either happen at build time
 * or compile time. It is very useful for libraries that are built for
 * distribution, but can be also compiled from seperate sources directly for
 * development, supporting build time switches.
