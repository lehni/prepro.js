Prepro.js is a simple preprocesssor for JavaScript that speaks JavaScript,
written in JavaScript, allowing preprocessing to either happen at build time
or compile time. It is very useful for libraries that are built for
distribution, but can be also compiled from separate sources directly for
development, supporting build time switches.
