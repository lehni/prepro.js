 * Prepro.js - A JavaScript based preprocesssor language for JavaScript

 *
 * Prepro.js is a simple preprocesssor for JavaScript that speaks JavaScript,
 * written in JavaScript, allowing preprocessing to either happen at build time
 * or compile time. It is very useful for libraries that are built for
 * distribution, but can be also compiled from separate sources directly for
 * development, supporting build time switches.
 *
 * Distributed under the MIT license.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *
 *  -i INCLUDE_JS -- include a JS file containing definitions and options
 *   that are required to be available at preprocessing time.
 *
 *  -c -- strip comments
